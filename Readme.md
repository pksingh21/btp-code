# test.py

This Python script contains functions for encoding numbers and performing operations related to Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) using the Charm-Crypto library.

## Dependencies

- `random`: Used for generating random numbers.
- `charm.toolbox.pairinggroup`: Used for operations related to Pairing Groups in cryptography.
- `charm.schemes.abenc.abenc_bsw07`: Bethencourt's Ciphertext-Policy ABE scheme.
- `charm.adapters.abenc_adapt_hybrid`: A hybrid adapter for ABE schemes.
- `pickle`: Used for serializing and deserializing Python object structures.
- `time`: Used for timing operations.
- `re`: Used for regular expressions.

## Functions

- `encode_number(x)`: This function takes an integer `x` as input and encodes it into two sets of binary strings, `S0_x` and `S1_x`. The binary strings are arranged in decreasing order of string length.

## Usage

This script is meant to be imported as a module in other Python scripts that require ABE operations. The `encode_number(x)` function can be used to encode an integer into two sets of binary strings.

## Example

```python
from test import encode_number

# Encode the number 10
S0_x, S1_x = encode_number(10)
print(f"S0_x: {S0_x}")
print(f"S1_x: {S1_x}")
```

This will output the encoded binary strings for the number 10.
