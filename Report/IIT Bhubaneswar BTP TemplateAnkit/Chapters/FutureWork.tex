\chapter*{Future Work}

In the forthcoming stages of project, we plan to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Make it an independent self deployable service by any person or organisation:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item The project aims to improve upon the existing code base and the pre existing solutions.
      \item Using containerizing technologies like docker and making it an independent web server we plan on make it a self hostable encrypted FTP server on which user can upload a file and can specify the access policy and then people with required credentials can access the FTP server and decrypt the data if their attributes satify the access policy.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Implement another efficient comparison algorithm and make it deployable on IoT devices:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item In the research papers that we came across while pursuing this project we came across some new algorithms which are even more efficient time and space wise compared to our solution which can be implemented and make the whole encryption process even more efficient and thus make it deployable on plethora of IoT devices..
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
